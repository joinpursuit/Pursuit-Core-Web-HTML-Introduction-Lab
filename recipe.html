    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>To make mangu</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>4 unripe plantains</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>4 tsp olive oil or butter</li>
      <li>1 cup water at room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Peeling:</strong> Peel the plantains (see how-to) and cut
        lengthwise, then divide each half into two. Remove the center where the
        seeds are located (optional, this is just my preference for a smoother
        mang√∫).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Boiling:</strong> Boil the plantains in enough water to cover
        them plus an inch until they are very tender, having added the salt to
        the water before the water breaks the boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mashing:</strong> Remove the plantains from the water and mash
        them right away with a fork until they are very smooth and there are few
        to no lumps (be careful not to burn yourself). Mix in olive oil, and
        water at room temperature and keep mashing and mixing until it turns
        into a smooth puree.
      </li>
    </ol>
